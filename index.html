    <h2>The Rocket</h2>
    <p1>
        The Clairian mk2 rocket consists of two main parts the Suborbital booster and the circulazation and transfer module or CTM.
        The booster is the main workhorse of the rocket itsself. Its job is to cut though the gravity and atmosphere of Kerbin to get the payload into a position where it can maintain a stable orbit.
        After the deltaV intensive parts of the mission are completed the CTM takes over. its main jobs are to burn to create a stable orbit and push the payload to its destination.
    </p1>
    <h3>Suborbital booster </h3>
    <p2>
        The Suborbital booster used in the Clairian Mk2 is one of the finest peices of engineering created by kerbal hands. It is powered by a single RE-M3 "Mainsail" Engine.
        this engine gives the rocket enough power to push through the gravity well of kerbin and into space after which it is jetisioned. After being jetisioned it maintains its trajectory and releases the covering for the heat sheild on its nose plummeting though the upper and lower atmosphere.
        When its speed has been reduced enough it glides on its fins to reach a landing point before releasing its parachutes and touching down ready to be refueled and reused.

    <h3>(CTM) Circulazation and Transfer Module</h3>
    <p2>
        The circulazation and transfer module takes over after the subobital booster has been depleted it will be the main power moving forward for the rest of the mission.
        its first task will be to put the craft in a stable orbit, followed by short correction burns, and finally initiating the main transfer burn to the Mun.
        During the Mun encounter it will preform a capture burn bringing it to less than 10Km above the surface! 
        After the surface mission has been completed it will use the last of its fuel to send our kerbals on their return journey.

    <h2>Payload</h2>
    <p1>Much like the rocket itsself the payload is split into 2 main components the Command and Rentry module or CRM and the Lunar Decent Module or LDM.
        The CRM is attached to the transfer module talked about previously and seats 2 kerbals; The lunar decent module however only seats 1. 
    </p1>
    <h3>(CRM) Command and Rentry module </h3>
    <p2>
        The CRM is the heart of the vessel it holds all of the life support and communications equipment as well as a hearty heatsheild in order to survive reentry.
        Most of the mission the kerbals spend tucked into this cozy pod its crew consists of a scientist and a pilot. during the lunar decent the scientist remains onboard and runs the pilot through the experiments that are happening on the surface.
        after the mission is complete and the kerbals are back in kerbins sphere of gravity it detaches and reenters kerbins atmosphere and lands via aerobreaking and parachutes.

    <h3>(LDM) Lunar Decent Module </h3>
    <p2>
        The LDM is what carries the Kerbal to the planets surface; it is crewed by a single kerbal and is unpressurized. It has a science lab on top that after the experiments are ran and the data is gathered the lab is unscrewed and pushed off the top of the lander to save weight for the rendevous.
        after the mission on the surface is completed it has enough fuel to rendevous with the CRM in orbit. The pilot then takes the surface samples and experiments and spaceswalks to the CRM where they head home.
